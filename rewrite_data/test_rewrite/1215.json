    "rewrite1": "Let's make some specific changes to the formatting of the document:\n\n- In the sixth paragraph, set the Outline level to Level 5. Then, alter the text color to the hexadecimal code #FAFAD2. Next, remove any highlight from the text and italicize it to emphasize the content.\n\n- Moving on to the ninth paragraph, assign an Outline level of 1 to structure it clearly. Increase the font size to 16 points for better readability, and add a 'word underline' for stylistic flair. Lastly, adjust the right indent to -12 points to align the text just right.\n\n- For the fifth paragraph, we'll start by removing the bold styling to soften its appearance. Set the first line indent to 1 cm to create a neat and organized look. Change the font color to a soothing blue, and finish off by applying a double underline for a touch of sophistication.",
